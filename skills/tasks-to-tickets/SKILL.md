# Tasks to Tickets

Turn one active OpenSpec change into vertical implementation handoffs. OpenSpec specs remain the behavioral authority and `tasks.md` remains the sole change-progress ledger. Tickets live beside `tasks.md` under the selected change's `tickets/` directory, not under `specs/` or an issue tracker. Publish one ticket per user review cycle; do not implement, check OpenSpec tasks, commit, sync specs, or archive.

## 1. Resolve the approved change

- Select the change named by the user. If ambiguous, list active changes and ask. Run `openspec status --change "<name>" --json` and `openspec instructions apply --change "<name>" --json`, preserving the selected root or `--store` flag. Require complete planning artifacts and a non-blocked apply state. Use the returned `changeRoot` and `contextFiles`; never assume the current repository is the change's home.
- Read every current context file: proposal, **all** affected capability specs, design, and tasks. Read any applicable repository policies (if present) and inspect the relevant project surface if it exists. Parse the actual checkbox labels in `tasks.md` (such as `2.3`), not the CLI's sequential array IDs. Compare them with apply's task count and descriptions. If CLI descriptions omit verification text because a checkbox is split across physical lines, surface the mismatch; request approval before repairing the task artifact, and do not publish tickets from an ambiguous task list.
- Read any existing `<changeRoot>/tickets/` entries before proposing more. Preserve user edits and completed tickets; never overwrite or renumber an existing ticket without separate approval. If source artifacts changed after tickets were approved, identify affected tickets for review rather than silently regenerating them.

## 2. Plan the next ticket

- Split by a narrow **end-to-end deliverable** that can be demonstrated or otherwise verified in one fresh implementation session, including the tests and user documentation that deliverable calls for. Reuse Matt `to-tickets`' vertical-slice and genuine-blocker reasoning, not its external-tracker setup. Setup work that genuinely gates a runnable slice may be included in that slice; a final integration/review ticket is a verification-only exception, not a fabricated product feature. Do not turn each horizontal checkbox into a ticket automatically.
- Track which OpenSpec checkbox labels and in-scope spec requirements and scenarios are covered by published tickets and which remain uncovered. Before each publication, choose one narrow deliverable and check its genuine blockers without introducing cycles or serializing independent work. If the approved tasks cannot cover the spec, or a task needs splitting, propose an OpenSpec artifact revision and wait for its separate approval.
- For the next ticket, name a stable `NN-kebab-case` ID, its observable deliverable, the exact OpenSpec task labels it contributes to, affected spec paths and requirement/scenario names, relevant design decisions, concrete acceptance checks, and the other tickets that genuinely block it. Use relative context paths from `tickets/`, so archived changes remain readable. Record `Status: open` or `Status: done` only; ticket checklist boxes are acceptance details, not a second progress ledger. An open ticket stays open until its entire deliverable is verified.

## 3. Publish one ticket, then stop for review

When the user requests ticket creation, write the next ticket directly to `<changeRoot>/tickets/<NN-kebab-case>.md` without changing another ticket or `tasks.md`. Show the published ticket and its task mapping and blockers, then stop. If the user requests revisions, update that ticket and stop for review again. Publish the next ticket only after the user confirms the current one. Before declaring ticket publication complete, show a task-to-ticket coverage table for every OpenSpec task and trace every in-scope spec requirement and scenario to a published ticket; resolve any gaps before proceeding to implementation. The local ticket form is:

```markdown
# <Title>

Status: open
Blocked by: <ticket IDs, or None>
Covers OpenSpec tasks: <checkbox labels, e.g. 3.1, 3.2>
Behavior source: <relative path(s) to affected specs, or None for non-behavioral work>
Design source: ../design.md
Task source: ../tasks.md

## Deliverable
<One end-to-end outcome; do not duplicate the normative spec.>

## Acceptance
- [ ] <Observable verification of this ticket's outcome>
```

For the **first** ticket placed under a change, read `openspec status --change "<name>" --json`, `openspec instructions apply --change "<name>" --json`, and run `openspec validate "<name>" --strict` afterward. Confirm the extra `tickets/` directory has not altered artifact detection, task counts, or validation; if it has, report the incompatibility and stop rather than changing the schema or location silently. Publication never grants permission to start implementation.
