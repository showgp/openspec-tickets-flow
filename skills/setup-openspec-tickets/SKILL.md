# Setup OpenSpec Tickets Flow

Configure the repo after `openspec init` and skill installation. Explore, present
findings, confirm the proposed changes with the user, then write.

## Process

### 1. Explore

Look at the current repo to understand its starting state. Read whatever exists;
don't assume:

- `openspec/config.yaml`: present? What do its `context`, `rules`, and
  `operations` sections already say? Never overwrite user content there.
- Root agent instructions: `AGENTS.md`, else `CLAUDE.md`. If neither exists,
  propose creating `AGENTS.md` with the approved section. If a flow section
  exists, edit it rather than adding another.
- Check `openspec --version` and `openspec list --json`; inspect the CLI's
  status for any selected active change, if one exists.
- Upstream skills present: `grilling`, `tdd`, `to-tickets` under
  `.agents/skills/` (or the project's skill directory). Missing ones mean the
  flow's step 2 (grilling before artifacts) and step 4 (scoped TDD) have no
  backing skill; report, and offer to install with
  `npx skills@latest add mattpocock/skills -s <skill> -y`.
- Which quality rules the repo already defines (linters, size limits, test
  policies). The flow skills read "applicable repository policies" at runtime;
  record where they live so reviewers can find them, but do not invent new
  quality rules here.

### 2. Present findings and confirm

Summarise: openspec CLI state, config.yaml current contents, agent-instruction
file choice (or proposed new `AGENTS.md`), present/missing upstream skills,
and existing repo policy locations. Write nothing yet. Take the sections in
order; one answer per section, recommended answer first.

**Section A — OpenSpec config rules.** Recommended: add these rules under
`rules.proposal` and `rules.tasks` in `openspec/config.yaml`, respectively:

```yaml
rules:
  proposal:
    - Include an explicit Non-goals section listing behaviors considered and excluded.
  tasks:
    - Put each checkbox, complete task description, and verification criterion on one physical line; openspec instructions apply --json exposes only that line as the task description.
```

If `rules` or `rules.tasks` already exist, merge rather than replace. Skip any
rule whose intent is already present. Explain in one line why the tasks rule
matters (apply JSON truncates to one line); if the user declines it, the
`tasks-to-tickets` skill will surface split lines as a repair question every
time, so get a decision either way.

**Section B — Agent-instruction section.** Add an `## OpenSpec ticket flow`
section to `AGENTS.md` (or `CLAUDE.md` if that alone exists). If neither exists,
ask to create `AGENTS.md` with this section. Draft from this template, trimming
to what the repo lacks:

```markdown
## OpenSpec ticket flow

- For a new change, run a grilling session with the user to confirm the complete
  requirements and non-goals. Do not create planning artifacts or code before
  the relevant approval.
- OpenSpec is the sole source of behavioral requirements. Read the selected
  change's current CLI status and instructions, and the artifact paths they
  return; do not substitute agent instructions, README, or tests for its specs.
- Draft the proposal, spec, design, and tasks separately. Obtain approval before
  writing each artifact, then stop for review. Do not use a one-shot workflow
  that generates all artifacts without these checkpoints.
- YAGNI is a scope gate: each new behavioral guarantee, defensive abstraction,
  and permanent test must trace to an approved OpenSpec requirement or an
  explicit repository quality rule. A review finding or a constructed edge case
  is evidence, not a blocking criterion; discuss credible trigger, user impact,
  simpler alternative, and cost with the user before adding handling or tests.
- In `tasks.md`, put each checkbox, complete task description, and verification
  criterion on one physical line; after writing or editing tasks, inspect
  `openspec instructions apply --json` output for counts and descriptions.
- Publish tickets one per review cycle with `tasks-to-tickets`; implement one
  approved ticket at a time with `implement-openspec-ticket` (scoped TDD at
  seams agreed with the user; real checks; observed CLI smoke), then stop and
  wait for permission. Reporting progress is not permission to continue.
- `review-openspec-ticket` performs the independent Standards and Spec review
  before a ticket can close. A test's passing or a review's zero findings never
  promote unapproved behavior into the spec.
- Syncing durable specs (`openspec/specs/`) and archiving a change each require
  separate explicit approval; do not commit on the user's behalf without
  approval.
```

Preserve the repo's own heading style. If the file already says any of this,
edit in place rather than duplicating.

**Section C — Upstream skill gaps.** Only if skills from the exploration are
missing: offer to run the installer commands for the missing upstream skills
and stop for the user's confirmation. Never fetch a different skill as a
substitute.

### 3. Write and verify

After the user approves both sections (and any missing-skill installation):

- Edit `openspec/config.yaml` (merge, never clobber).
- Add or update the agent-instruction section in the agreed file.
- Re-read both files and confirm the approved rules and section are present,
  without duplicate headings or discarded existing content. Do not create a
  sample change; this skill only writes configuration.

### 4. Done

Report exactly what was written, and the first command to run next:
discuss a real request with `grilling`, then create one OpenSpec change and
walk the approval chain. Mention that per-project quality rules (linters, size
limits) stay the repo's own responsibility and are read by the flow skills
from this file.
